# QuadIIDX
this is an iidx theme based on iidx 11 till iidx 16 made from just quads

this means it will also exclude fonts and sounds, just the basic stuff as a base for future themes

atm I'm working on iidx 14 but will add the option to switch between versions in the theme

this theme is complete open source for everyone to use/edit

# Scoring
this theme uses moneyscore from iidx, its mostly based on

https://remywiki.com/IIDX_General_Info#How_is_your_money_score_calculated.3F

with some ajustments made

you can check the code at https://github.com/Jousway/QuadIIDX/blob/master/Scripts/IIDXSCORE.lua

#credit

this theme is mostly made by me, with some help from people in #stepmania-devs at irc.rizon.net now and then

mostly help from kyzentun


I'll also like to credit the SSC for bringing the future of stepmania
